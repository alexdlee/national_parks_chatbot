# National Parks Chatbot
This is a Python-based chatbot that serves as a guide to national parks across the United States! It can build itineraries for you, give you tips about national parks themselves, and answer tons of questions about which national parks are a good fit for you based on your preferences! Great for families or adventurers.

## Features (Work-in progress)
Features of this application include a functioning AI chatbot, ability to provide online tips about national parks, creating itineraries for users by using nearby attractions/restaurants in a 10 mile radius of the national park, and suggesting particular national parks to visit based on time of year and user preferences.

# Future Modifications
Chatbot is currently a work-in progress, working on making it fully functional and implementing all the features listed above.

## Setup
Work-in progress.
